# ConfigME
by Michael Engel
------------------------------------------------------
This class shall ease programming any type of scientific code.
To get familiar with this style of programming, the user can use the config-class as a dictionary.
I highly recommend taking advantage of the importME-method as it can import anything from anywhere!
Another key feature of this class are the parsing methods which go through your scripts and look after config-callers.
By using this, writing config-files is extremely easy as even arguments of imported modules are queried and automatically written into your files!
Have fun!
